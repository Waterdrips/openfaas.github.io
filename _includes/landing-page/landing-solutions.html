                OpenFaaS enriches Kubernetes with scaling, queueing, monitoring, and event triggers, so your team can focus on shipping features.
            <p class="has-text-weight-light is-size-5 is-size-4-desktop has-text-grey mt-2">
                Compared to plain Kubernetes, customers said that they are now shipping functionality to production within hours.

            <p class="has-text-weight-light is-size-5 is-size-4-desktop has-text-grey mt-2">
                Functions can be run on-demand, or on a schedule, and can be triggered by events from your existing systems like Apache Kafka or AWS. If you invoke them asynchronously, you'll also get to benefit from retries without writing any additional code.

                deel.com migrated from AWS Lambda to Kubernetes, only to find that their code would no longer scale how they needed. They reached out to us, and we wrote up a reference architecture.

                One function, many clouds

            <p class="has-text-weight-light is-size-5 is-size-4-desktop has-text-grey mt-2">
                Does your product need to run on different clouds, including on-premises? Perhaps you're considering writing an abstraction layer to cover your bases?

                When faced with this question, <a href="https://www.openfaas.com/blog/low-code-automation/" style="text-decoration: underline;">Waylay.io</a> built their low-code platform with OpenFaaS.

            <p class="has-text-weight-light is-size-5 is-size-4-desktop has-text-grey mt-2">
                OpenFaaS functions are built as OCI images, which means they're portable, and integrate well with teams who use containers or Kubernetes already.
