We've now launched a new OpenFaaS SWAG and Insiders Subscription program, so that you can show your support and faas in style.

## A message from Alex

Here's a message from myself, Alex, the project lead and founder of OpenFaaS about our new SWAG store.

{% include youtube.html id="SzKbMXBiv7s" %}

> Did you know? OpenFaaS, inlets and OpenFaaS Cloud are all hosted by OpenFaaS Ltd, and given away for free including community-support. I also want to let you know about other ways you can show your support for our work in the community and stay up to date with your OpenFaaS deployments.

### Order online

We have both OpenFaaS and [inlets](https://inlets.dev/) t-shirts available for self-service in small quantities made out of super-soft cotton.

> If you would like to place a bulk order, feel free to email [sales@openfaas.com](mailto:sales@openfaas.com) for a discount on shipping. All bulk orders come with a shipment of free SWAG - stickers, magnets, and other goodies.

* Order your shirt today on [https://store.openfaas.com/](https://store.openfaas.com/)

### Inlets PRO available for purchase

You can also get your very own [inlets-pro](https://docs.inlets.dev/) license, for personal use. Inlets is a Cloud Native Tunnel that integrates with Docker, Kubernetes, systemd and runs on Mac, Windows and Linux.

<img src="/images/2020-swag-store/inlets-pro-purple.png" width="200" height="200">

[inlets](https://docs.inlets.dev/) is a free OSS project built by community, it's a Cloud Native tunnel that works for L7 or HTTP/s traffic and can be configured however you like, with or without TLS. Inlets PRO adds in a range of features such as automatic TLS and a TCP proxy that works at L4 meaning you can tunnel anything you like - from SSH to databases to a Kubernetes IngressController.

Both inlets and inlets PRO make a great addition to OpenFaaS and mean that you can get a public IP address and TLS certificate for your local Kubernetes cluster.

Find out more on our new documentation site [inlets documentation](https://docs.inlets.dev/#/pricing).

If you're using OpenFaaS in some way, a fan of our work, or even in production, you really should subscribe. It's designed so that you can pay whatever you want, you decide the value, from less than the cost of a coffee.

Here's a excerpt from my GitHub Sponsors page:

![sponsors](/images/2020-swag-store/sponsors.png)

> You'll also get news on Cloud Native, Kubernetes, Docker, DevOps, Security and the range of OSS projects I contribute to and maintain.

[Buy now through GitHub Sponsors - from 5USD](https://github.com/sponsors/alexellis/)

### Write your use-case in the ADOPTERS.md file

One of the questions on our Slack community form is whether you use OpenFaaS at work, and out of 2400 people, well over 50% of them all said that they do, which means that we only have a fraction of that usage recorded, and less than 120 of those folks have an Insiders Subscription.

So, there's one other way you can support our OSS projects and community, by sharing your use-case in the ADOPTERS.md file. It won't cost you anything, and you could inspire someone to share their story too.

Simply send a Pull Request to [ADOPTERS.md for OpenFaaS](https://github.com/openfaas/faas/blob/master/ADOPTERS.md), or send us an email if that's easier.
